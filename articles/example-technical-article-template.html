      <h2>Context and problem statement</h2>
      <p>This document explains a concrete technical problem and how to approach it in a production environment. The focus is on clarity, explicit trade-offs, and decisions that are defensible in front of senior engineers.</p>
      <p>Rather than chasing trends, we describe the constraints, moving parts, and failure modes that matter when the system is under load or evolving quickly.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Architecture and design considerations</h2>
      <p>Good architecture starts from use cases and operational constraints. Before picking tools, make sure you understand data flows, latency expectations, availability requirements, and ownership boundaries.</p>
      <p>Write down what 'good enough' looks like for this system over the next 12–18 months. This prevents accidental over-engineering while still leaving room for the system to grow without constant rewrites.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Implementation guidelines</h2>
      <p>Implement the smallest viable slice that exercises the critical paths: how data enters the system, how it is processed, and how results are exposed. </p>
      <p>Keep configuration in version control, favour small, composable modules, and invest early in basic observability so that on-call engineers can understand what is happening during incidents.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Operational concerns and monitoring</h2>
      <p>From day one, decide how you will detect and respond to failure. This includes basic health checks, log aggregation, and simple dashboards that show high-level system health without requiring deep dives into raw metrics.</p>
      <p>Document standard operating procedures for common failure scenarios so that engineers can respond quickly and consistently.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Summary and next steps</h2>
      <p>A sustainable solution balances delivery speed with operational simplicity. Even if you start with a minimal implementation, make sure the path toward hardening and scaling is clear.</p>
      <p>As a next step, identify one or two metrics that correlate strongly with user experience, and instrument them clearly. This will help you make informed trade-offs as you iterate on the system.</p>
